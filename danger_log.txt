Danger Log for ECE568 HW1
Zuhang Xu; Yikai Liu

What we accomplished:
1. We have @login_required, which allows only authenticated users to access their index pages and all other pages.
2. We use CSRF_TOKEN in all forms to ensure security.
3. Instead of passing in user_id into the url each time, we implement the view with session, which is more secure. 
4. We also ensure when you want to request a ride or a share form, you can not pass in a non-positive passenger number.
5. We use django built-in user authentication which does not require you to put a password in a self-defined database. This is more robust and secure.

Further Robust related questions:
6. We are not sure about data race situations in Django and how to prevent such cases. For example, if two drivers want to confirm the same ride at the same time.
